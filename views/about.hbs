    <p>I'm a musician who finds ear training apps useful and necessary every now and then. The first app that I used for ear training was the built-in training module found in the wonderful Band-in-a-box. I remember its Pitch Envasion where you need to identify the pitch of different instruments. The chord exercises in that software are the best I have used, too. I'm most comfortable with its categorization of chords and the way to select complexity. The sad thing is, I lost the computer that carries the older version of Band-in-a-box. The version that I'm using now doesn't have Pitch Envasion.</p>
    <p>These days it also makes more sense to have a mobile app that can go with you anywhere. I've tried some that are available on the phone. Although most of them look similar and prettier, none of them has the specific functionalities that I want. Since I studied web programming this year, I think to myself, it's time to make one for my own, and let's make it both desktop and mobile friendly!</p>
